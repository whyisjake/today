# Privacy Policy for Today RSS Reader

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

## Overview

Today RSS Reader ("Today", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS and macOS application.

## Information Collection

### What We DON'T Collect

Today **does not collect, transmit, or store** any personal information on our servers. Specifically:

- ❌ No personal identification information
- ❌ No usage analytics or telemetry
- ❌ No crash reports sent to us
- ❌ No tracking cookies or identifiers
- ❌ No advertising IDs
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No contact information
- ❌ No email addresses or accounts

### What IS Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored **only on your device** using Apple's secure storage mechanisms:

- **RSS Feed URLs**: The feeds you subscribe to
- **Article Data**: Downloaded article content, titles, and metadata
- **User Preferences**: Your chosen settings (theme, accent color, font preferences, etc.)
- **Reading History**: Which articles you've read, favorited, or marked
- **Audio Preferences**: Your selected text-to-speech voice

All this data:
- Remains on your device only
- Is protected by iOS/macOS system security
- Is backed up via iCloud if you have iCloud Backup enabled
- Is deleted when you delete the app

## Third-Party Services

### Network Requests

Today makes network requests to:
1. **RSS Feed Servers**: To download article content from the feeds you subscribe to
2. **Embedded Content**: Articles may contain images/videos hosted on external servers
3. **AI Service** (Optional): If you use AI features, article content is sent to your configured AI provider

**Important**: These are direct connections to the content sources you choose. We don't intercept, store, or have access to this data.

### AI Provider

If you choose to use AI features:
- Article content is sent directly to your AI provider (e.g., OpenAI)
- You must provide your own API key
- The AI provider's privacy policy applies to that data
- We recommend reviewing their privacy practices

## Data Security

- All data is stored using Apple's secure storage APIs (SwiftData/UserDefaults)
- Network requests use HTTPS when supported by feed sources
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have any!)

## Children's Privacy

Today does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app does not require any personal information and is safe for all ages. However, content from RSS feeds may not be appropriate for children - parental guidance is recommended.

## iCloud Sync

If you have iCloud enabled, iOS/macOS may back up:
- Your app settings
- Your subscribed feeds
- Your article read/favorite status

This is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud services. Please review [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) for details.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to delete, export, or modify. You have complete control:

- **Delete Your Data**: Uninstall the app
- **Reset Settings**: Use the app's settings or delete and reinstall
- **Export Feeds**: Use OPML export (if implemented)

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted:
- In the app's About section
- On our website (if applicable)
- In App Store update notes (for significant changes)

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Open Source

## Summary

**TL;DR**: We don't collect any data. Everything stays on your device. We can't access your information because we don't have any servers. Your privacy is 100% protected by design.
