# Today RSS Reader - Project Summary

## What Was Built

I've transformed your basic SwiftUI app into a full-featured RSS reader with AI-powered content summarization! Here's what's included:

### âœ… Core Features Implemented

#### 1. RSS Feed Management
- Add/remove RSS feed subscriptions
- Organize feeds by category (work, social, tech, news, general)
- Manual and automatic syncing
- Track last sync time for each feed

#### 2. Today View
- Display articles from the last 7 days
- Filter by category/thread
- Search functionality
- Mark articles as read/favorite
- Swipe gestures for quick actions

#### 3. AI-Powered Summarization
- Local AI using Apple's NaturalLanguage framework
- Chat interface for asking questions
- Automatic trend analysis
- Keyword extraction from content
- Article recommendations

#### 4. Background Sync
- Automatic background updates
- Configurable sync intervals
- iOS-optimized for battery life

## Architecture

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Feed.swift          # RSS feed subscriptions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Article.swift       # Individual articles
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RSSParser.swift     # RSS/Atom feed parsing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FeedManager.swift   # Feed operations & sync
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AIService.swift     # Local AI summarization
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BackgroundSyncManager.swift  # Background tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TodayView.swift     # Main article list
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FeedListView.swift  # Feed management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AIChatView.swift    # AI chat interface
â”œâ”€â”€ TodayApp.swift          # App entry point
â””â”€â”€ ContentView.swift       # Tab navigation
```

## Technology Stack

- **UI**: SwiftUI with declarative syntax
- **Database**: SwiftData (Apple's modern Core Data replacement)
- **RSS Parsing**: XMLParser (built-in, handles RSS 2.0 and Atom)
- **AI/ML**: NaturalLanguage framework (local, no internet required)
- **Concurrency**: Swift async/await throughout
- **Background Tasks**: BGTaskScheduler for background sync

## Next Steps

1. **Open the project**:
   ```bash
   open Today.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Add files to Xcode** (see SETUP.md for detailed instructions)
   - Right-click "Today" folder â†’ "Add Files to Today..."
   - Add Models/, Services/, and Views/ folders

3. **Configure Background Modes**:
   - Add "Background Modes" capability
   - Enable "Background fetch"
   - Add task identifier to Info.plist

4. **Run the app** (Cmd+R in Xcode)

5. **Add some RSS feeds**:
   - Daring Fireball: `https://daringfireball.net/feeds/main`
   - Hacker News: `https://news.ycombinator.com/rss`
   - The Verge: `https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml`

## Key Implementation Details

### Data Model
- **Feed** â†’ **Article** (one-to-many relationship)
- Cascade delete: Removing a feed deletes all its articles
- Articles identified by GUID to prevent duplicates

### RSS Parsing
- Supports both RFC 822 and ISO 8601 date formats
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Extracts: title, link, description, date, author

### AI Features
- Trend analysis by feed and category
- Keyword extraction using part-of-speech tagging
- Conversational query matching
- Article recommendations based on recency

### Background Sync
- Minimum 15-minute intervals (iOS limitation)
- Creates temporary ModelContext for background work
- Handles multiple feeds concurrently
- Continues on individual feed failures

## Performance Considerations

- **SwiftData @Query**: Reactive - views auto-update on data changes
- **Lazy loading**: Lists use LazyVStack for memory efficiency
- **7-day window**: Today view only shows recent articles
- **Background limits**: iOS controls actual sync frequency

## Future Enhancements

If you want to expand this further:

1. **Advanced AI**:
   - Integrate Core ML models for better summarization
   - Use MLX Swift for on-device LLMs
   - Add sentiment analysis

2. **Features**:
   - Offline reading mode (cache full article content)
   - Share articles
   - Export to reading services (Pocket, Instapaper)
   - Custom category creation
   - Read statistics and insights

3. **UI/UX**:
   - Dark mode customization
   - Custom themes per category
   - Article view customization (font size, etc.)
   - Widget for home screen

4. **Sync**:
   - iCloud sync across devices
   - Import/export OPML feed lists
